  "intro": "Hey there, everyone! Welcome back to the podcast where we dive deep into the world of AI and machine learning. Today, we’ve got some really exciting stuff lined up for you. First up, we’re going to explore how multi-stage training enhances DeepSeek-R1’s reasoning abilities compared to its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1-Zero. It's like giving a super-smart brain an even better education! \n\nNext, we’ll tackle the big question of whether reinforcement learning should take the lead over supervised fine-tuning when it comes to building advanced language models. This one is going to spark some serious debate and discussion.\n\nSo grab your thinking caps and get ready for a fantastic episode ahead. Let’s kick things off with how multi-stage training takes DeepSeek-R1 to the next level!",
  "outro": "Thanks so much for joining us on this episode! We've had a fantastic conversation about taking DeepSeek-R1 to the next level with multi-stage training, which gives it a leg up on readability and reduces those pesky language mixing issues present in its predecessor.\n\nBut we also dove into some bigger questions: should reinforcement learning be our top priority when building advanced language models? Our research suggests that while RL can lead to impressive reasoning capabilities, it's not the only game in town. Readability and coherence are crucial for making these models practical and useful, but they don't always align with pure reasoning power.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you - what are your thoughts on this trade-off between reasoning capability and readability? Do you have any favorite AI-related topics or questions you'd like us to explore in future episodes? Hit us up with a comment or suggestion - we're all ears!\n\nThanks again for tuning in, and we'll catch you on the next episode!\""
